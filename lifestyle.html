                Navigating the world of at home skin care is a minefield.
                With so many new devices and products around, it is hard to know where to begin, and then of course
                there is the cost to factor in.
                Whether you’re yearning for a full face sculpt or prefer to focus on key areas like your cheeks, eyes or
                jaw line, we have some face workout tips that can do the trick whilst at home.

                These days we seem to all be after a natural beauty look, as we all embark on getting to know our bare
                faces, skin-imalism has emerged as the greatest beauty trend of all.
                Going forward we want to look barefaced, but better.
                It’s not that we no longer want enhanced cheekbones, in fact “Facial Contouring” searches have gone up
                by 150%, according to Bobbi Brown.
                To fill the void of ‘traditional’ sculpt and contouring using makeup, face training is the subtle cult
                that arises to keep you toned and fresh-face allowing you to maintain definition with or without makeup.

                Performing high intensity but non-invasive methods can help your skin care products work for your skin
                and give you extra definition, serving that envied glow we see on all our favorite models and
                influencers.
                Regular facial muscle manipulation on your face improves the blood flow and supplies your skin cells
                with nutrients, leading to a product of collagen which our skin requires to prevent or reduce the
                formation of wrinkles.
