            <h5>FUN FLORALS</h5>

            <p>
                <i>
                    The first idea that pops up into my mind when I think about Summer is a bright floral Sundress. They
                    look really cute, laid-back but also quite elegant. You can pair it up a pair of comfortable
                    flip-flops and and half of your outfit is done. You can add some more sass to it by pairing it up
                    with a Summer hat and a cute bag, talking of which Circular Jute Bags are very much in trend these
                    days. Put on some minimalist chunky jewellery and there you go!
                </i>

            <h5>COMFY CO-ORDS</h5>
            <img src="coords.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                <i>
                    Next up is this amazingly beautiful two piece co-ord that is totally trending at this hour. Co-ords
                    look really cool, classy and trust me, they are super comfy. You can wear it almost everywhere
                    during Summer, be it on a day out, or while you are on the beach or even on a night out. You can
                    accessorise it with some catchy earrings and a pair of simple yet cool footwear, and you shall need
                    nothing else to ace at Fashion this Summer!
                </i>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5>DENIM</h5>
            <img src="summer2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                <i>
                    Denim skirts are totally back in trend, these days and you may as well try one out this Summer. I
                    really like this combination of a denim skirt with an off-shoulder striped top. It looks really
                    stylish and vibrant, bringing about the true essence of Summer. As for accessories, a pair of hoop
                    earrings, a classy handbag, a pair of fashionable shades and lastly, comfortable footwear, will do
                    just right!
