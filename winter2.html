                When it comes to your winter wardrobe, goal number one should be to protect yourself from cold weather.
                But that doesn't mean that you can't have fun with winter fashion.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Wear three layers.</b>
            <p>
                Your base layer might consist of silk underwear, a merino wool turtleneck, and leggings—thin,
                moisture-wicking basics that will keep you warm without making you sweat. Your middle layer can be
                something like a thick fleece for insulation. And the outer layer—a winter coat or parka—serves as a
                barrier against wind and rain.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Keep it tight.</b>
            <p>
                Tight-fitting clothing will help prevent wind chill. Swap wide-leg jeans for skinny jeans, which also
                help visually balance out oversize knit sweaters and chunky boots. Wear fleece-lined tights or leggings
                under skirts and dresses to keep your legs warm.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Wear long coats.</b>
            <p>
                Cropped puffers might be trendy, but if your aim is to stay warm, you need to keep your entire torso
                covered. Make sure you have at least one long sweater and coat for the coldest days.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Accept that you can pair sweaters with skirts. </b>
            <p>
                Try a chunky cable knit pullover with a knee-length pencil skirt. Looser maxi and midi skirts work with
                sweaters, too: Try the French tuck, and wear a statement belt to balance the look.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Choose the right type of down.</b>
            <p>
                Down is a great material for keeping warm since it’s lightweight while also insulating. When it gets
                wet, however, it quickly loses its puff. Synthetic down is heavier, but it stands up to rain. For rainy
                weather, you’ll either want synthetic down or a separate rain shell to protect your down jacket.
